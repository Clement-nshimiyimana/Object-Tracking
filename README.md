# Object-Tracking

This is part of my computer vision coursework at the African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) program taught by Georgia Gkioxari, research scientist at Facebook AI.

This project involves building a simple object tracker in real-time that detects objects in video frames using predictions from detectron2 model, and links these predictions across time frames.

Part A involves detecting objects in a frame, Part B involves tracking objects in pairs of frames and finally, Part C involves tracking objects in a video.
